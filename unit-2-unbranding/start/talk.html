  <p class="speaker-a">We need to talk.</p>

  <p class="speaker-b">What?</p>

  <p class="speaker-a">I know you're cheating on me. I know you lied to me. Look at you, on a date right now.</p>

  <p class="speaker-b">I don't know what you're talking about.</p>

  <p class="speaker-a">You know, after all this time, I thought you were better than this. I thought you loved me Elizabeth.</p>

  <p class="speaker-b">Elizabeth?</p>

  <p class="speaker-a">Oh, now you want to act like your name isn't Elizabeth? Like you don't know me? That's really low of you.</p>

  <p class="speaker-b">I hate to tell you this, but my name isn't Elizabeth and I don't know who you are.</p>

  <p class="speaker-a">Excuse me?</p>

  <p class="speaker-b">Could you remove your sunglasses?</p>

  <p class="speaker-a">...Ohhhhhhhhhh. See, I knew wearing unprescribed sunglasses inside was a bad idea.</p>

  <p class="speaker-b">Could you please go now? You're interrupting our date. I'm so sorry Gary.</p>

  <p class="speaker-a">OOOOH right I'm so sorry. Sorry Gary. Carry on. I have to call Elizabeth.</p>

  <title>Talk</title>

  <p>We need to talk.</p>

  <p>What?</p>

  <p>I know you're cheating on me. I know you lied to me. Look at you, on a date right now.</p>

  <p>I don't know what you're talking about.</p>

  <p>You know, after all this time, I thought you were better than this. I thought you loved me Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth?</p>

  <p>Oh now you want to act like you don't know me? That's really low of you.</p>

  <p>I hate to tell you this, but my name isn't Elizabeth and I don't know who you are.</p>

  <p>Excuse me?</p>

  <p>Could you remove your sunglasses?</p>

  <p>...Ohhhhhhhhhh. See, I knew wearing unprescribed sunglasses inside was a bad idea.</p>

  <p>Could you please go now?</p>

  <p>OOOOH right I'm interrupting. Carry on. I have to call Elizabeth.</p>
